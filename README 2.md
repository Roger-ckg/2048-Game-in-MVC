2048
====
A Java Re-Implementation of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This version tried to stay as true to the original as possible in terms of the looks and feel.

Additional Features
-------------------
* Allow the user to manipulate tiles with the mouse left click.
* Allow the user to change the dimensions of the board (up to 20x20).
* More to come?

Any and all suggestions are welcome!
